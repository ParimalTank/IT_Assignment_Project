                Encryption and Decryption using SSL/TLS certificate :

                Install the openssl on your machine:

                For Windows:
                Download openssl for windows https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. Install the MSI.

                echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
                source ~/.bash_profile

                Create SSL certificate using following command:

                    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt

                    Extract the public key component from certificate using following command

                    Command to extract pubkey from certificate

                    openssl x509 -noout -pubkey -in certificate.crt -out pub.key

                    Upload the public key to server “Upload Public Key” Button

                    Server has generated the random no. in file and encrypted it with public key provided by you. Server has used following command to encrypt the file

                    openssl rsautl -encrypt -in test.txt -pubin -inkey pub.key -out cipher.txt

                    Encrypted file is sent to you through the mail. Download it and decrypt it using the following command

                    openssl rsautl -decrypt -in cipher.txt -inkey private.key
